# OpenMLS group-key lifecycle laboratory (isolated)

This is **not the PictoChat production cryptography stack**. It is a separate Rust crate proving an MLS library can manage multi-device group membership without inventing new cryptographic ratchets.

## Demonstration

- OpenMLS `0.9.2`, `openmls_rust_crypto 0.6.0`, and `openmls_basic_credential 0.6.0`.
- Different provider instances model separate end-user key stores.
- A first member creates a group; a second member publishes a KeyPackage.
- The first member sends a Welcome after an Add commit.
- The second member processes Welcome and obtains the same group epoch.
- A text/sketch-like UTF-8 message is MLS-encrypted by the first member, authenticated and decrypted by the second member.
- The first member removes the second via an MLS commit, advancing the group's epoch.
- After applying the removal, the evicted member's group becomes inactive; creating a new group message is rejected.

The same test crate now has **two separate integration tiers**:
- `tests/relay_integration.rs` sends real MLS Welcome, application, and removal-Commit bytes through `pictochat_relay::Rooms`, the exact in-memory broadcast mechanism used by our Rust WebSocket server.
- `tests/websocket.rs` connects two true WebSocket peers to the loopback server. It transmits actual OpenMLS-produced Welcome, application ciphertext, and removal Commit messages, and verifies the removed device loses the ability to send. This test is ignored during ordinary `cargo test` and explicitly executed by the MLS GitHub Actions workflow after starting the relay.

Run `cargo test` in `mls-lab/`. For the live WebSocket integration, start the server with `PICTOCHAT_RELAY_SECRET` and run `cargo test --test websocket -- --ignored` in the lab. Only use local, non-sensitive development data.

## Reusable endpoint-side native client API (new)

`src/client.rs` now provides a reusable **volatile Rust MLS client** that owns its OpenMLS crypto provider and signing keys. It implements group creation, KeyPackage generation, adding a member, Welcome processing, application encryption and authentication, Commit merging, epoch inspection, and removing members. Its `Incoming` result distinguishes application messages, membership changes and local removal. Framing helpers enforce v3 kind and size rules before TLS deserialization.

`tests/client_api.rs` exercises three independent clients, sends multilingual text, adds and removes members, verifies new-epoch encryption still works for allowed peers, and rejects stale/forged-kind/replayed control frames. For a runnable demonstration, execute:

```sh
cd mls-lab
cargo run --example three_devices
```

GitHub Actions runs this example as well as the unit, integration, Clippy and live WebSocket tests. **This is not yet a user-facing browser or production CLI**: keys and identities are ephemeral, methods that cannot recover in a test may still panic, and there is no durable state, authentication directory, certified identity lifecycle, or automatic offline recovery.

## Client hardening and reconnect contract

The reusable endpoint-owned client now returns explicit `Result` errors for malformed incoming frames and invalid MLS states rather than deliberately panicking in these public operations. The tests cover uninitialized clients, duplicate group creation, malformed TLS frames, invalid transitions, stale replays and oversized plaintext. A conservative 8-KiB application plaintext limit is enforced **before** MLS encryption to leave space for the fixed 16-KiB WebSocket transport framing.

**Fail-closed reconnect:** call `Client::mark_transport_interrupted()` whenever a WebSocket closes or the application cannot prove that all MLS Commits were received. This blocks `send`, `add`, `remove`, and `process`, even if the old cryptographic group object still exists. Reconnecting to the WebSocket by itself **cannot** mark the group synchronized. To restore service, the caller must intentionally abandon the old group with `abandon_group_for_rejoin()`, obtain a **new authenticated Welcome** and ratchet tree through a separately verified membership process, and call `accept_welcome()`. The application must verify inviter credentials externally before doing so.

This deliberately prioritizes avoiding stale-epoch sends over seamless reconnect. There is no automatic offline MLS Commit mailbox, no authenticated invitation directory, and no durable identity recovery. Abandoning the in-memory group is not a verified secure wipe of all provider state, browser memory or swap. No remote deployment should depend on this prototype.

## Separation and security limits

**Browser integration status (November 2026):** The original PictoRust browser at `/` still uses experimental AES-256-GCM with an independently shared key plus ephemeral P-256 signatures; it does **not** negotiate MLS epochs. A new explicitly separate experimental browser at `/mls` now compiles the same Rust OpenMLS client to WebAssembly and has a successful real two-Chromium-peer test covering KeyPackage, verified owner, Welcome, encrypted application message, epoch advance and removal. The source is in `mls-web/` and `server/public/mls.*`. This is **not** equivalent to shipping MLS inside the original DS interface, nor production readiness. The relay now **also** accepts the opaque MLS transport framing v3, while leaving browser protocol v2 untouched. It does not parse or validate OpenMLS protocol contents. This is a transport test, not a deployed browser MLS client.

Production prerequisites:

1. Pick the actual **client** MLS implementation (the secrecy boundary must stay on the endpoint). Rust native, WASM and JS interop must be assessed rather than putting MLS decryption keys into the relay.
2. Define exact validated key-package publication, fingerprint/credential authentication, Welcome/Commit delivery and group epoch synchronization.
3. Because the app intentionally avoids server-side message retention, decide how an offline member obtains missed commits and how the client recovers from a stale epoch without persisting chat content. An optional, explicitly bounded encrypted control-message mailbox may be necessary, or reconnecting clients may have to rejoin.
4. Handle conflicts, member removal/revocation, malicious administrators, key-package replay and account recovery.
5. Commit `Cargo.lock`, pin transitive dependencies, add dependency and security auditing, stronger adversarial tests, and a protected release process.
6. Independently security-review all code before claiming secure private communication.

## MLS transport v3 (experimental)

A WebSocket binary frame has one version byte `0x03`, followed by a one-byte kind and the unchanged TLS-serialized MLS payload:

| Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0x01` | MLS application message |
| `0x02` | MLS membership Commit |
| `0x03` | MLS Welcome |
| `0x04` | MLS KeyPackage |

The relay only enforces an allowed kind and total 3–16384 bytes; there is **no** authenticated MLS group routing or verified membership in the server. All messages still broadcast to currently connected holders of the bearer room capability. MLS validation and secret handling **must** remain on client devices. KeyPackage discovery, specific Welcome targeting, offline recovery, ordering, and durable group identities are not implemented. The v2 browser is not upgraded and may ignore v3 messages.

A passing MLS test proves only these specific integration flows, **not end-to-end security of the shipping browser application**.

## Browser WASM integration and group access policy

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo install wasm-pack --version 0.13.1 --locked
wasm-pack build mls-web --target web --release --out-dir pkg
cd server
PICTOCHAT_RELAY_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" cargo run
# Open http://127.0.0.1:8787/mls on the same host.
```

The [browser MLS GitHub workflow](../.github/workflows/pictorust-browser-mls.yml)
compiles the real WASM, starts the Rust relay, and tests two independent
Chromium browser pages. The exported screenshots are redacted to keep room
admission tokens and Welcome material out of test artifacts.

**Membership policy:** A group owner may add an externally fingerprint-verified
single-use KeyPackage or remove a member by its current leaf index. A joiner
must enter and externally verify the owner's Ed25519 signature key before
using the room. Both local add/remove and incoming authenticated MLS Commits
are checked against the pinned owner key **in Rust**, not only in HTML.

**Unresolved release-critical controls:**
- Joining currently uses manual out-of-band Welcome and ratchet tree delivery.
  There is no server-backed authenticated identity directory or automatic
  offline catch-up.
- Each room still shares its bearer admission token. MLS removal revokes
  *cryptographic membership* after applying the epoch-changing Commit but
  **does not revoke relay socket admission**, so an evicted peer retaining
  that token could still cause traffic or denial of service.
- A dropped WebSocket fails closed and requires a verified new Welcome; no
  zero-data-loss reconnection or persistent MLS key store is implemented.
- The new browser chat is a separate MVP page. The original DS-themed page
  still uses v2 and will require UI convergence before the final release.
- A successful test is not an independent cryptographic audit.
