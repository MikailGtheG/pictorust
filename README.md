# PictoRust

**PictoRust** is the new name for the ongoing Rust and TypeScript modernization of the original Nintendo DS PictoChat browser implementation.

> **Original creator credit:** This project is derived from [ayunami2000/ayunpictojava](https://github.com/ayunami2000/ayunpictojava). The original Java/browser work, DS sprites and bundled font are retained with attribution. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for rights and provenance; this fork is independent and unaffiliated with Nintendo.

## Release candidate status

The Rust relay is entering an **internal localhost-only `v0.2.0-rc.1`**
verification phase. This is not a public release or a production-grade secure
messenger. Review the [release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md), the
[RC verification workflow](.github/workflows/pictorust-release-candidate.yml)
and [real Chromium screenshot workflow](.github/workflows/pictochat-browser-screenshots.yml)
before judging readiness. The binary is deliberately not published while
upstream asset redistribution terms and the browser MLS security gates remain open.

## Visual verification

The screenshot and PDF integration workflow renders a real two-peer browser session with the original DS assets, Unicode and drawings, then checks print pagination at A4 dimensions. Its review artifacts contain:

- `pictochat-original-lobby.png` – original room selection with updated session controls.
- `pictochat-original-top-messages.png` – framed text, drawing and bilingual chat in the top DS screen.
- `pictochat-original-stage.png` – full original two-screen layout.
- `pictochat-original-draft-box.png` – pen/drawing field and original frame.
- `pictochat-mobile.png` – narrow-screen viewport verification.
- `pictorust-export-page-1.png` – high-resolution nearest-neighbor source raster.
- `pictochat-print-preview.png` – actual Chromium PDF page rendered to PNG.
- `pictochat-print-demo.pdf`, `pictorust-multipage-demo.pdf` – downloadable print proofs.

The workflow produces new review artifacts on each tested update; do not substitute mockups for test screenshots.

The modern client is in `frontend/`, the volatile Rust relay is in `server/`, and the independent OpenMLS security laboratory is in `mls-lab/`. The graphical interface reuses the original fork's PictoChat sprites and pixel font.

**PictoRust PDF export:** renders a continuous original-width Nintendo DS sprite chat strip, without resetting the conversation at each 192-pixel screen. Each 256×520 logical raster is rendered from integer-aligned glyph bitmaps and pre-upscaled 4× into a 1024×2080 PNG, then printed at 512×1040 CSS pixels and centered on an A4 portrait page. Message frames stay intact across page boundaries. Original nds.ttf font and sprite backgrounds are used; no headers, footers, explanatory notes, access tokens or document-style cards. Browser export is client-only. The local browser holds the history only for the active session.

This development branch is not ready for a public deployment: OpenMLS is not yet integrated into the shipping browser. The original Java implementation remains below for historical compatibility.

don't get scammed kthx

## In-app commands
- `!block` / `!ignore` / `!unblock` / `!unignore` - Hide/unhide the messages of someone temporarily.
- `!tripcode` / `!tc` - When provided with a password, will generate a tripcode and send it as the server. Used for verification that someone is who they say they are.
- `!list` / `!l` - Lists online users.

## Discord commands
- `!list` / `!l` - Lists online users.

## Self hosting
You will need:
- Git
- Gradle
- Java 8+ (JDK)

(All of theses steps happens in the terminal/command line)
1) Clone the repository with the git command (`git clone https://github.com/ayunami2000/ayunpictojava`)
2) Get in the newly created folder with the cd command (`cd ayunpictojava`)
3) Make gradlew executable (`chmod +x gradlew`) (Windows: skip this step)
4) Build the project with gradle (`./gradlew build`) (Windows: `gradlew.bat build`)
5) Once you see the message "BUILD SUCCESSFUL in []s", a new folder will have been created called `build`
6) Go into this build folder, then into the libs folder
7) You will see a file named ayunpictojava-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar or an equivalent, this is the compiled program!
8) Copy this file to its' own folder for running, and run it (`java -jar ayunpictojava-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) (or whatever the .jar file is named)
9) You should see a line in the terminal saying that the server is running on 127.0.0.1:8080, once you see this you can try it out at http://localhost:8080

### Changing the port and bind address
By default, the application will bind to the local address and port 8080. This means that by default it will not be accessible to anyone else on your network.
To make it accessible, edit the `settings.json` file that is generated after being run at least once, and set host to `0.0.0.0` or `::`. Rerun the program to apply changes.
You can change the port and other configurable settings as well in a similar manner.

### Making tripcodes unique
To make tripcodes unique and reduce the risk of cracking, in the `settings.json` file, set the `tripcode_secret` to something unique and do not share it.

### The captcha
To use the captcha, set the `secret` in the settings.json to your Cloudflare Turnstile captcha secret.
To disable the captcha entirely, edit the `www/index.html` file and search for `let token = false;` and change it to `let token = true;`. Then, remove or comment out the `<div id="captcha" ...` element and the `<script src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/ ...` element.
